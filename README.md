# Social Media Simulation Platform

A React-based application that models social media discourse dynamics, user behavior patterns, and platform mechanics. This simulation explores how different user types interact, how content spreads, and how platform policies affect overall discourse quality.

*Note: This README was mostly generated with assistance from AI language models.*

## Overview

This platform simulates a social media environment where users with different personalities create posts, react to content, and evolve their behavior based on engagement feedback. Unlike traditional "likes" systems, it uses nuanced reactions (Strong Agree to Strong Disagree) to encourage more thoughtful discourse.

## Key Features

### User Types
The simulation includes five distinct user archetypes:

- **Normal (üôÇ)**: Balanced users representing typical social media behavior
- **Joker (üòÜ)**: Comedy-focused users who prioritize humor and entertainment
- **Troll (üòà)**: Controversy-seeking users who thrive on bait and divisive content  
- **Intellectual (üßê)**: Insight-driven users focused on thoughtful analysis
- **Journalist (üìù)**: News-oriented users with high credibility and responsible posting

### Content Attributes
Posts are characterized by six key dimensions:

- **Humor**: Entertainment value and comedic content
- **Insight**: Analytical depth and thoughtful perspectives  
- **Bait**: Low-quality engagement farming tactics
- **Controversy**: Divisive or inflammatory content
- **News**: Current events and factual information
- **Dunk**: Critical takedowns and roasts

### Platform Mechanics
- **Nuanced Reactions**: Five-point scale from Strong Agree to Strong Disagree
- **Community Moderation**: User-driven bait flagging system
- **Vibe Tags**: "Good faith discussion" labels that protect against bait flags
- **Follower Dynamics**: Growth and loss based on content quality and engagement
- **Learning Algorithm**: Users adapt their posting strategies based on what gets engagement

## Core Assumptions

The simulation is built on several key behavioral assumptions:

### Content Performance
- **Humor and Bait do Well**: Funny content and engagement tactics drive the most reach. This is followed by Controversy, Insight, News and Dunk in that order.
- **Bait, Controversy, and Dunks Get the Most Comments**: People are compelled to comment on things that trigger their tribalism.
- **Bait, Controversy, and Dunks Get the Most Flags**: For the same reason, these posts also get flagged the most
- **Agrees and Comments Translate to Increased Followers**: If a post gets Strong Agrees, Agrees, or Comments, that user's follower amount will go up
- **News and Controversy are Conflated**: People interperet news as controversy: if a post's News score is higher than Controversy, we boost the Controversy score to match it
- **Vibe Effects**: The tone system (vibe flagging) is meant to add context to a post, such as "earnest discussion". This reduces the probability a post will get flagged as bait. It also reduces Humor (earnest discussion isn't funny), Controversy (a hot take becomes just an opinion), increases Insight (because people know you've thought about this), and increases the number of comments you get (because you are encouraging discussion).


### User Behavior  
- **Learning from Success**: Users adapt strategies based on what gets engagement. Negative engagement negatively reinforces (getting "Disagrees" might make you less likely to post that type of content). This is also different on a user-type basis (for example, Trolls like Strong Agrees *and* Strong Disagrees)
- **Type-Specific Preferences**: Each user type has different base posting strengths / strategies, which they slowly revert to over time absent of learning
- **Network Effects**: Follower count provides reach advantages with diminishing returns

### Platform Dynamics
- **Moderation Effectiveness**: Community flagging can reduce reach of low-quality content
- **Policy Impact**: Algorithm changes significantly affect discourse patterns
- **Virality Patterns**: Content spread follows realistic local vs. global audience dynamics

3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time charts showing engagement patterns, content evolution, and user behavior
4. **Analyze Results**: Review metrics for different user types and content attributes
5. **Iterate**: Extend the simulation or try different configurations to explore various scenarios

## Example Use Cases

### Research Applications
- **Content Moderation Studies**: Test different approaches to community-driven moderation
- **Algorithm Impact**: Examine how platform policies affect discourse quality
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Study learning patterns and strategy adaptation
- **Polarization Research**: Investigate factors that drive consensus vs. disagreement

### Educational Uses
