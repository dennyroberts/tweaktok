# Social Media Simulation Platform

A sophisticated React-based application that models social media discourse dynamics, user behavior patterns, and platform mechanics. This simulation explores how different user types interact, how content spreads, and how platform policies affect overall discourse quality.

## üéØ Overview

This platform simulates a social media environment where users with different personalities create posts, react to content, and evolve their behavior based on engagement feedback. Unlike traditional "likes" systems, it uses nuanced reactions (Strong Agree to Strong Disagree) to encourage more thoughtful discourse.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Simulation Engine
- **Multi-User Types**: Five distinct user archetypes with unique behavioral patterns
- **Content Attributes**: Six-dimensional content classification system
- **Dynamic Learning**: Users adapt their posting strategies based on engagement feedback
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live charts and metrics tracking simulation progress

### User Types
1. **Normal (üôÇ)**: Balanced users representing typical social media behavior
2. **Joker (üòÜ)**: Comedy-focused users who prioritize humor and dunking
3. **Troll (üòà)**: Controversy-seeking users who thrive on bait and divisive content
4. **Intellectual (üßê)**: Insight-driven users focused on thoughtful analysis
5. **Journalist (üìù)**: News-oriented users with high credibility and vibe usage

### Content Attributes
- **Humor**: Entertainment value and comedic content
- **Insight**: Analytical depth and thoughtful perspectives
- **Bait**: Low-quality engagement farming tactics
- **Controversy**: Divisive or inflammatory content
- **News**: Current events and factual information
- **Dunk**: Critical takedowns and roasts

### Platform Mechanics
- **Nuanced Reactions**: Five-point scale from Strong Agree to Strong Disagree
- **Community Moderation**: User-driven bait flagging system
- **Vibe Tags**: "Good faith discussion" labels that protect against bait flags
- **Follower Dynamics**: Growth/loss based on content quality and engagement
- **Virality Modeling**: Realistic content spread patterns

## üî¨ Key Assumptions & Mechanics

### Content Performance
- **Humor + Bait = Engagement**: Funny content and engagement tactics drive the most reach
- **News = Controversy**: News content naturally generates controversial discussions
- **Insight Takes Time**: Thoughtful content gets steady but slower engagement
- **Controversy Polarizes**: Divisive content creates extreme reactions

### User Behavior
- **Learning from Success**: Users adapt strategies based on what gets engagement
- **Type-Specific Preferences**: Each user type has different utility functions for reactions
- **Homophily Effects**: Users preferentially engage with similar-minded content
- **Follower Influence**: Larger audiences provide reach advantages but with diminishing returns

### Platform Dynamics
- **Bait Penalty System**: Community flagging reduces reach of low-quality content
- **Vibe Protection**: Earnest discussion tags provide moderation immunity
- **Algorithmic Boosts**: Platform-level policies can favor/suppress content types
- **Network Effects**: Local vs. global audience exposure patterns

## üìä Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Comedy-Focused Platform
```javascript
// Boost humor, suppress bait
boosts: {
  humor: 0.5,      // 50% boost to funny content
  bait: -0.3,      // 30% penalty to low-quality content
  // ... other attributes
}

// Higher joker percentage
mix: {
  Normal: 40,
  Joker: 30,       // More comedy-focused users
  Troll: 5,        // Fewer trolls
  // ... other types
}
```
**Expected Result**: More humorous discourse, reduced toxicity, higher overall engagement

### Scenario 2: Educational Platform
```javascript
// Boost insight and news, suppress controversy
boosts: {
  insight: 0.4,    // Favor analytical content
  news: 0.3,       // Promote factual information
  controversy: -0.2, // Reduce inflammatory content
}

// Higher intellectual percentage
mix: {
  Normal: 30,
  Intellectual: 40, // More analytical users
  Journalist: 20,   // More credible sources
}
```
**Expected Result**: Higher quality discourse, more thoughtful engagement, slower but deeper discussions

### Scenario 3: High Toxicity Environment
```javascript
// Weak moderation, boost controversial content
baitRatioThresh: 0.8,    // Hard to flag as bait
baitPenaltyMult: 0.8,    // Weak penalties
boosts: {
  controversy: 0.3,       // Reward divisive content
  bait: 0.2,             // Reward engagement farming
}

mix: {
  Normal: 30,
  Troll: 30,             // High troll percentage
  Joker: 20,
}
```
**Expected Result**: Increased polarization, more extreme reactions, potential quality degradation
